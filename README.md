The app will take some time to start up the first time you launch it. This is a consequence of NativeScript, the cross-platform framework used to build it, and the fix appears to require an older version of the platform at the moment.

Anyway, this is a timer app for keeping track of repeated routines with both timed and untimed steps. You might use it for lab procedures, workouts, recipes, lesson plans, ... your call. It's a cross-platform app written in NativeScript (Angular/TypeScript, XML, CSS).
